# RockinProjex
The main site for all Projex that are Rockin!

Original idea by C. T. - January 2024

Hello, World!
I am C. T., also known as RockinProjex. Feel free to also call me RPX.

Would you believe it that this is the 4th time I've made this site? Me neither!
The first one was a private WordPress site, I would have to host the files in order to look at my "Site".
The second was using a free service, won't say which, but its user support was terrible, it kicked my site offline many times in the 3-month span I was with them for.
The last one was using Google Sites. This was a test and I didn't want it to last. Screw Google.
Now, I've wound up here. This is single-handedly THE best site to host a website on.

I reference 'Projex' and 'Rockin' quite a lot - they do, after all, make up my sites's name. 'Projex' - project(s), 'Rockin' - good, enjoyable, etc.

Anyway, now on to the actual section.


# READ BEFORE USE

I know not a lot of people will read this, so thank you for having an attention span higher than a goldfish.

In RockinProjex, referred to as RPX from now, you will see the home screen. Please use your eyes to navigate the site, you have them for a reason! /j

There are many pages, but the start page will only take you to some of the other pages. RPX is a project site where many of the things featured are fun web projects. 

Here's the run-down *after* pressing the _hamburger menu_:

# Tree 1: Games + Interactives

On the homepage, click on 'Games' or 'Interactives'. This will take you to the same place, but are separated so even your grandmother won't get confused.

The site should now show you featured Game/Interactive Projex. This can be voted on by you, eventually. For now, it will be either any game I choose, or the newest additions.

When you can finally vote on it, I must warn you of 2 things:
First, the site may not update on set intervals. I am a pity party of one, so please respect the fact I may not be able to update the site every week, month, day, whatever it may be. The best chance of it updating is when I add new Games/Interactables.
Second, there will be a 'New' section from that point on. It will help you keep up with the new Projex!

From this page, you can choose to either go back to the main page or to a certain Projex.

You may also navigate to other main trees.

# Tree 2: Music

On the homepage, click on 'Music'.

The site should now show you featured Music Projex. This can be voted on by you, eventually. For now, it will be either any music I choose, most popular on Youtube/SoundCloud/BandLab/Bandcamp/Spotify/Apple Music etc. or the newest additions.

When you can finally vote on it, I must warn you of 2 things:
First, the site may not update on set intervals. I am a pity party of one, so please respect the fact I may not be able to update the site every week, month, day, whatever it may be. The best chance of it updating is when I add new Music.
Second, there will be a 'New' section, and separate sections for being the top of the charts in their respective service, e.g. 'Apple Music Top 50', from that point on. It will help you keep up with the new Projex!

From this page, you can choose to either go back to the main page or to a certain Projex.

# Tree 3: VGA

On the homepage, click on 'Art' or 'VGA'.

When you can finally vote on it, I must warn you of 2 things:

# What Next?

Those were the main 3 trees. There may be more soon, but those are the current ones. You will be able to find misc content using the misc. section, but it won't be as prominent.

As for what next,
