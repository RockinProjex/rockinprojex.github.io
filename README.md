The main site for all Projex that are Rockin!

Original idea by C. T. - January 2024

Hello, World!
I am C. T., also known as RockinProjex. Feel free to also call me RPX.

Would you believe it that this is the 4th time I've made this site? Me neither!
The first one was a private WordPress site, I would have to host the files in order to look at my "Site".
The second was using a free service, won't say which, but its user support was terrible, it kicked my site offline many times in the 3-month span I was with them for.
The last one was using Google Sites. This was a test and I didn't want it to last. Screw Google.
Now, I've wound up here. This is single-handedly THE best site to host a website on.

The website is self-explanatory, just open up rockinprojex.github.io in a new tab.
