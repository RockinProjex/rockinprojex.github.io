# RockinProjex
The main site for all Projex that are Rockin!

Original idea by C. T. - January 2024

Hello, World!
I am C. T., also known as RockinProjex. Feel free to also call me RPX.

Would you believe it that this is the 4th time I've made this site? Me neither!
The first one was a private WordPress site, I would have to host the files in order to look at my "Site".
The second was using a service, won't say which, but its user support was terrible, it kicked my site offline many times in the 3-month span I was with them for.
The last one was using Google Sites. This was a test and I didn't want it to last. Screw Google.
Now, I've wound up here. This is single-handedly THE best site to host a website on.

Anyway, now on to the actual section.


# READ BEFORE USE

I know not a lot of people will read this, so thank you for having an attention span higher than a goldfish.

In RockinProjex, referred to as RPX from now, you will see the home screen. Please use your eyes to navigate the site, you have them for a reason! /j

There are many pages, but the start page will only take you to some of the other pages. RPX is a project site where many of the things featured are fun web projects.
